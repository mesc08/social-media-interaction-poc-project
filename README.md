Project Overview:
The project is a social media application where users can create posts, follow other users, and interact with the content. It consists of a frontend application built with React.js, a Golang microservice for user management and post creation, and a Java microservice for social interactions like following and liking posts.

Components:
1. Frontend:
   - Technology: React.js
   - Description: The frontend application provides an interface for users to create posts, browse content, follow other users, and interact with posts through likes and comments. It communicates with the backend microservices via REST APIs.

2. User Management and Post Creation Microservice (Golang):
   - Technology: Golang
   - Description: This microservice handles user registration, authentication, and post creation. It communicates with a PostgreSQL database for storing user information and post details. Additionally, it integrates with a file storage system (e.g., AWS S3) for storing and retrieving user profile pictures.

3. Social Interaction Microservice (Java):
   - Technology: Java
   - Description: This microservice focuses on social interactions between users, such as following other users and liking posts. It communicates with a MySQL database for storing social relationship details and post interaction information.

4. Database (PostgreSQL):
   - Technology: PostgreSQL
   - Description: PostgreSQL is used to store user information, including usernames, passwords, and user profile details. It also stores post data, such as the content, timestamp, and reference to the user who created it.

5. Database (MySQL):
   - Technology: MySQL
   - Description: MySQL is used to store social relationship details, including follower-following relationships, and post interaction information, such as likes and comments.

Workflow:
1. Users interact with the frontend application built with React.js, which sends requests to the appropriate microservices.
2. The Golang microservice handles user-related requests, including registration, authentication, and post creation. It communicates with the PostgreSQL database for user and post data storage.
3. The Java microservice receives requests related to social interactions, such as following other users and liking posts. It communicates with the MySQL database for storing social relationship and interaction data.
4. The microservices send responses back to the frontend application, which renders the results for the user.

This example demonstrates a full-stack microservice architecture where Golang and Java handle different aspects of the application logic. The Golang microservice focuses on user management and post creation, interacting with PostgreSQL and a file storage system. The Java microservice focuses on social interactions, communicating with MySQL for storing social relationship and interaction data. React.js is used for the frontend, which communicates with the microservices through REST APIs.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and the actual implementation may vary based on specific requirements and preferences.
